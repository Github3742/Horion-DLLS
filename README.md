# Horion-DLLS
## How to use ##
Download FateInjector.exe and pick a dll that matches the version you want to use. If you want to change your bedrock version I would personally recommend BedrockLauncher, which you can find the download to at https://bedrocklauncher.github.io If you have any issues or want to add to the collection, dm me at Flamestyx#2076 on discord
